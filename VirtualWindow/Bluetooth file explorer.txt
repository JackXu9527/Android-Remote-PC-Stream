//things to do
1) research how to read media file byte by byte and display those bytes to media (just use any sort
of media framwork because I will develope this in android again anyways)

Phone side idea
1. Detect file hierachy
2. Provide user name and password
	2A. Once it's correct, remember password and username and display
2. Download file to view  .jpg, .png, .txt, .pdf
3. Stream video, music. But user can decide to download it
	3A. Stream and book mark video
	3B. Video subtitles
	3C.
